    = Retiree Rudi, ran the business
    Rudi saw a lot of things in his long life. When he was younger, he often leads the group, but now that he is 73 years old, he appreciates it if someone else manages decisions. He has become forgetful and now more and more relies on his family to help him.\
    During his every day life, he often forgets the small things. His wife and children have to remind him often of tasks he still has to do. This makes him feel like a burden for the others. Because of this, he wants to improve on his forgetfulness and tries to rely less on others.
