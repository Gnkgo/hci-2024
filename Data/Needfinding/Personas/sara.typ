    = Student Sara, shy as can be
    Sara is a 25-year-old student. She is very shy and rarely speaks in groups of more than 3 people. When it comes to decision-making in such groups, she never opposes any decision and always goes with the flow. Consequently, many group activities that get chosen by her group are not to her taste. Because of this, she is often unhappy and participates in group activities less often.\
    Many times, she has good alternatives in mind when it comes to such activities. However, she does not have the courage to speak up because she fears that the others might not like her proposals. Ideally she would like a democratic vote for such activities.
