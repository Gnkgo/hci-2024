## Question 1: What keeps you busy in everyday life?

*"Primarily my studies at ETH, as well as trying to pursue my hobbies and going to sports every once in a while."*

### Can you describe this in more detail?

*"Which part?"*

### Generally, what exactly concerns you about it, for example?

*"So I would say everything in Uni is primarily about passing exams, getting as much information stored in my head for as long as possible. When it comes to my hobbies, those vary a lot. Right now I am doing some projects like knitting, sports and doing. Concerns be there is mainly my health and the aspects of that feeding into my the more mental abilities again."*

### How does it make you feel?

*"Again, which part?"*

### What you said before.

*"It can be overwhelming at times, but I like being busy, so it's also very satisfying feeling."*

## Question 2: When do you make decisions in everyday life?


*"It depends on the scale of the decisions. Small decisions I make literally every split second. When it comes to the bigger ones, I think those happen about once or twice a day. They are usually also related to university."*

### Can you give an example as what you would classify as bigger and smaller decisions?


*"Small decisions should I take the tram to go to university or should I look? Bigger decisions are should I take this morning off in order to look after my own health?"*

### how do you feel when you take those decisions? Again, in both categories, small and big.


*"Small ones ironically can always be a bit more overwhelming because they need to be made on short term, but they usually don't have bigger consequences, so it doesn't concern me as much. As for the bigger ones, I usually have to think about it, but once I've taken the decision, I no longer concern myself with it."*

## Question 3: How do you feel in a group?

*"That depends on the group. On the one hand side, the already established social dynamics of that group. On the other hand side, also the size of the group. Mid-sized groups usually make me feel the most comfortable."*

## Question 4: How did the last group get-together come about?

*"The last group get together was in my student house in the kitchen where we had some spontaneous talks. So we very much already knew each other."*

### And is that usually the case that something like this happening or was there a specific trigger for it?

*"No, that is very common."*

### Can you maybe think of an example where it was uncommon that the group would meet, where it's not just given from the situation?

*"Let me think for a second. Wow. Yes, I would say so there was one example would be for again a new course I had in university where I knew some people that had studied with me before and some that did not. So it was very much an unusual constellation of people. I already knew of people who I did not know."*

### And what was the trigger there for that get together?
*"The new course."*

## Question 5: Can you describe a situation in which the group has made a decision?

*"I would say for that specific example of the new dynamic in the group, so during my university course, I don't think we made any big decisions at all because there were still no group dynamics established. It was more about are we going, I think we talked about getting a coffee or something.And then with the usual groups of decisions that are taken,much like in the most recent times were for example, discussing how the next house party should go about and that was very heated."*

### How did the overall decision process work?

*"In the established group, the decision process was very much chaotic. People who were very direct and did not, were not very cooperative. In the newly established group, that was not the case. It was very much of a, okay, let's do that. But I do feel both of these scenarios are a bit hard to compare because of the scale of the decisions that were taken."*


## Question 6: How did it make you feel?

*"Neither of them concerned me very much. Getting a coffee, I did not care about emotionally enough to really concern myself with it. The house party will not affect me either, but what did affect me there was the unfriendly atmosphere."*


## Question 7: If you have several options available, how do you decide which one to use?

*"I usually think about which options are the worst and I eliminate them first. And then when it comes down to a few options, especially when it's about bigger decisions, I usually weigh them in a pro and con like type of decision making before then finally thinking again like which decision would I not want to happen more?"*


## Question 8: When youâ€™re with your friends, how do you decide how and what to eat?

*"That depends on the friends. If I'm with someone who needs a routine or feels very strongly about their choices, then I will usually go along with their opinion. Same goes for when the discussion has gone on for too long. Otherwise, I will propose something, especially when I'm with friends who have a hard time making decisions."*


## Question 9: Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced this?

*"It can, yes, especially when discussion is driven for too long."*
 

### Can you describe this in more detail?

*"So for example, when we keep talking about, well, I'm assuming we're just talking about lunch, right? When we keep talking about something that for me is not very relevant and does not matter as much, and it keeps being dragged out, I feel like the discussion is very much pointless. And that makes me feel a bit frustrated."*

## Question 10: Do you feel like a decision maker?

*"I think I, yes, I do."*

### Can you name one positive and negative experience you had with this position as a decision maker?

*"A positive outcome would be that I have control over my choices more than when other people would make these decisions for me. A negative outcome would be that with that control, it controls responsibility."*
