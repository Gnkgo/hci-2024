# Transcript
## Question 1: What keeps you busy in everyday life?
*"What keeps you busy in everyday life? I work in the lab in the pharmaceutical science, so most of the time I do programming a statistics but I also equipped with biological lab techniques and experiences before."*

### Can you describe this more in detail?
*"So I'm afraid I cannot tell you I too deep down to detail because there is a problem with confidentiality, but it has abouted a a trace drug so basically a drop with radio radioactive label, blanket, and how is interacts with different tissues in our body."*

### And what concerns you about it?
*"And for me, I'm not really proficient. I didn't really have a degrees in statistical modeling, so for me, the biggest challenge to is to adapt into this completely new type of work for me because I'm more used to biology and chemical chemistry lab."*

## Question 2: When do you make decisions in everyday life?
*"That's a very good question. I think I wouldn't really say I have a I have a certain point I have to make decision rights, in the right now during the during my work, but during my life, I do have lots of experience about position. uh as a pharmaceutical science students, I need to decide in which the department I am going to dedicate myself in and how can I structure my career part in the future."*

### How does it make you feel? 
*"Sometimes it's kind of influence me, but I think that both emotionally and also sometimes feel exhausting, but I think this is also a essential part of growing up, I will say, of your life journey."*

## Question 3: How do you feel in a group?
*"I feel myself you mean my team work right?"*
### Yeah, for example.
*"I feel myself I'm more like a team player. I'm not a team leader, I'm also not a team follow, because at one hand I think that's to leader groups to to cooperate with different people, to have an idea to be decisive is important, but also you need to consider other people other opinion, that's why you have to find out the position and there should be flexible anxatine. Some time would be more like associated, sometimes be like a leader. I think that will be the best for a effective teamwork."*

## Question 4: How did the last group get-together come about?
*"The last time I feel myself um working in the initiative is during is organizing the events Korea working days. So I was responsible for um organizing a program, a program organizer, and yeah, and I feels quite it was the first time, so I learned a lot, but I still realized that I have a lot of things ahead of me as do need to learn."*

### What's the trigger of this group get-together?
*"What do you mean by trigger? Do you mean how it took our team viewed up or what do you mean how did it start?"*
### How where and how why did you get there? 
*"Because I have the um the president of the team, I know her personally and she invited me to join because I was the the old the only one representative from the master from the city science, the others are from the master pharmacy. So there's also they want that the organizing comitee team to be more inclusive."*

## Question 5: Can you describe a situation in which the group has made a decision?
*"That's a good question. I mean, we always have our online um Zoom meeting. So uh it's basically we have like voting. We do like uh we have the voting on the WhatsApp. We have also voting on the zoom. So I think we follow the very basic democratic um voting system. So I think everyone are kind of fair we don't have a clash quite often, so yeah, I guess that answers your question."*

## Question 6: How did it make you feel?
*"Yeah, I mean sometime if the position of the team which is different for off from my opinion sometimes you kind of like disappointed, but I think that's it is important that sometimes I need to think about which decision and which one is the most it's the better one for the entire team. I think the most beneficial the opinion which is the most beneficial for the team is the best one, and sometimes you have to sacrifice your own opinion."*

## Question 7: If you have several options available, how do you decide which one to use?
*"I mean I mean here it is between line two things. So first, you need to consider all your own personal will, but also the thing about what actually can benefit the team the most, right? Yeah. So it's something between, I would say, as my consideration."*

## Question 8: When youâ€™re with your friends, how do you decide how and what to eat?
*"I mean, I remember we have this uh this this final dinner of the organizing comedies. I think the present of the organizing comedy desire where we go and she and then we I didn't know the restaurant and she book it and it appears to be very good said he ends and yeah, but usually when I was the other people, sometimes I decide sometimes they decide for it.*"

### And with friends?
*"I mean what I spend my time with my boyfriend, I drew decide where we go."*

## Question 9: Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced this?
*"Can you elaborate this question a bit more like, how, what do you mean and how the decision making process?"*

### Like how you decide what to eat or what to do or whatever? What if it affected like the outcome and how you felt about it and how you experienced it?
*"I mean it is it affect me personally or if you mean that's how it affects me both may be personally and how it effects if I mean, you think that's that's um for as I would say personally, we should not take these kinds of like position or the other people didn't um agree with me. We shouldn't take that we shouldn't take it personal. uh I think we should as a add a person, we should manage our um emotion and a moral rational way and I don't think this decision will affect a law in person, but on the other hand, you talk about the final outcome, sometimes the the democratic decision or decide by someone else wouldn't be the best one, but sometimes you have to know that um this is also kind of the process. and there is that might not be the the best outcome at the ends. And I think that the team will also learn lesson from it."*

## Question 10: Do you feel like a decision maker?
*"Yeah, because, like like every time I get go with my boyfriend, I decide where we go to eat and where we go to travel, I decide for a basic plan like most of the things. And also yeah, like when I worked in my group, I still remember, I also decided last time. I think sometime if you have this kind of like a influence that you can you show your decisiveness, you show your competence and people who start to trust you and you can decipher more. That's the thing."*
### Okay, can you name a negative experience? 
*"That I'm not the decision maker?"* 
### No, like is there a sitation where a negative experience when you decided something didn't go well or it or something like that?
*"I don't really take it into person and I don't really remembrance. Yeah, sometimes when they decide when when I I went for I in a lab group, sometimes they decide to do something, which I think is essentially wrong, but I think I don't really it doesn't really affect the fact laws at the ends. I'm afraid I can ask if you an answer because of my personality. I don't really take a serious."*
### Why didn't you take the lead? 
*"In this situation take what?"*
### Take the leadership of the decision process, when you said they did the wrong decision.
*"I mean sometimes I do, but I do think that you you also need to take care of about entire teams and sometimes you realize that if you are two dominants and you might not be the one who always provides best solution, sometimes you do it, it is not the most most beneficial solution for entirety and I. I wouldn't do that. I will only do that if I know thats it is necessary. if they have to learn it. Yeah. Okay."*

That's it. Thank you very much.
