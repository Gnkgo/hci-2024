## Question 1: What keeps you busy in everyday life?

*"Well, that's kind of tricky because my everyday life drastically changed. Like every month ago. I'm currently on my gap here and I plan to be working for my paragliding school four days aweek and do EYP [European Youth Parliament] work next to it. But now I broke my foot. So I can't go to work. And what kept me busy was basically organising a member's event for the European Youth Parliament now in the last two weeks and meeting lots of friends, learning Spanish as well because I'm going to Chile in three weeks. That's kind of like what kept me busy. It's kind of an unusual situation since I didn't anticipate I would break my leg. But here we are."*

### Is there something that concerns you about it? 

*"Only that my leg won't get fine again. Like that it will have long lasting "Schäden" [sic]"*

## Question 2: When do you make decisions in everyday life?

*"How do you mean that?"*

###  Any kind of decisions you take.
*" I think every minute you make decisions, no?. I think if we go through a typical day of my life, the first decision is am I going to wake up now? Am I going to stand up now or am I going to lie in my bed for another five minutes? That's all decisions I make. Then I decide whether I want to wear a blue top or a brown one. I decide whether I want to eat cornflakes for breakfast or a bread. I think there are many decisions made in everyday life. Some of them are unconscious. Some of them are very conscious. I think major life decisions I mainly make in the late evening or, like, at night. Since I feel like that is the time when I am most reflective and self-aware. And all the other minor decisions just happen throughout life."*

### And how does it make you feel?

*"Decision making?"*

### Yeah. In the scenarios you described before.
*"So there are decisions that are harder for me than others obviously. For me there is always a big question of, hey, what do I want to do with my life? What do I want to do in the future? Since I graduated in July and now I am basically free to do whatever I want. Which is amazing but also a lot of responsibility. And kind of the first time in life I can freely choose what I want to do. It makes me somewhat anxious sometimes since I feel like I could choose so many things that aren't the perfect fit for me or that are wrong maybe also. I think the more options you have, the harder it is to decide at some point or to focus on something. But I think there is also beauty in it having lots of options and having to decide. And I think with every decision you make you get to see your own life. And that is something that makes life unique and beautiful I think."*


## Question 3: How do you feel in a group?

*"It very much depends on the group. Do you mean like a group of my friends for example or school or any kind of group?"*

### Both

*" That very much depends on what kind of people I am spending my time with or in what kind of group I am. For instance with my friends I often feel safe. I feel heard. I feel like there are people in my life that care about me and that makes me feel good. And also to some extent important or like that my existence makes a difference or is appreciated. If I spend time in a group of... I don't know, strangers in a train for example. I often think about term saunter. It describes the feeling when you realize that every single person has their own life, their own story. And like live in their own level and they are the main character of their own life. And that often occurs to me in trains for example or train stations when I like... Wow, all these people like they've been living for so long and they have such a complex life just as me. And somehow we all weave into each other. Like everything that we've seen to each other but at the same time we're also all very... singular in this journey. It's basically just us, it's just us, yeah."*



## Question 4: How did the last group get-together come about?

*"Okay, so actually we're sitting at the last group get-together that happened to me. It's the members weekend of the European Youth Parliament Switzerland. And it's an annual event that happens to train members to become officials. Where they have responsibilities, right? They take on roles to bring something to life together to create something. And I actually head-organised that event with one other girl. And I had a lot of fun doing it. I really appreciated it. I appreciated the opportunity and the great support I got during this organising process. And now we've already got 33 people from all over, so I'm coming together to exchange knowledge, to get to know each other, to make friendships. And that's a way more beautiful people. And every time I get to an EYP event I think about how cool life is and how cool it is that we just get to spend... this precious time together. Yeah."*

### Do you have an example which is a little bit less official?

*"Um... Let me think. The last group get together... Mmm... I guess it was the NSC [National Selection Conference] before. Like for a big group or is like a group of three people. I mean I had three friends of mine come over maybe a week ago. In the last two weeks I used to ask friends to cook it and cook lunch with me. So that I'm not that lonely while I work for life. And all three of them are in the music profile but two years under me. But I know all three of them from different backgrounds but they are also friends together. And we're kind of like that crew before and we love to do music together. And we just spend people left and singing and harmonizing and finding songs that we all know. And yeah, just creating music together and that was just beautiful. Since I kind of miss music since I ended school. It's different to not have like a regular schedule where I do music. Since I was in the music profile I have piano lessons, I have singing lessons. So I was confronted with like four times a week at least. And now since July I kind of disappeared out of my life a little bit. And seeing those friends again was amazing just to get back to the passion of mine."*

## Question 5: Can you describe a situation in which the group has made a decision?

*"Sure. I mean it was us we cooked lunch together. So the first decision was like, oh hey, what are we going to cook for lunch? And should I describe how we make the decision?"*

### Yeah.

 *" I made a group chat because first I only invited one girl, and the second girl heard that one girl is coming over to my house and said hey can I join?. And then the third one was also like, hey, can I join? I was like sure. So I did a group chat and I made some propositions for proposals of what we could cook together. I think it was like summer rolls, sushi, lasagna, stuff like that. And then one of the girls was like, hey, I really loved the idea of doing summer rolls. I think that sounds very cool. So that's what we ended up with. And then I searched out a recipe. I wrote down all the stuff that they should buy before they come to my house since I can't really go grocery shopping. And yeah, another decision was like, hey, when can we come? I was like, hey, 11 is perfect for me. Does that work? And that's kind of how the whole afternoon came together."*

## Question 6: How did it make you feel?

*"I know that often times in groups, I'm the one that's kind of leading or proposing a lot of stuff. I'm the one that comes up with ideas or suggestions and kind of initiates a lot of things. So I'm kind of used to steering a group or like leading a little bit. And I was fine. Like sometimes I wish that other people would also do that a little bit more because I oftentimes feel like in my surroundings, people know that I have the capacity to lead and I will do it and I will organise stuff. So they feel like they aren't responsible for it anymore. But sometimes I'd appreciate if they would also suggest something instead of just asking what I was suggest. So it's always kind of like it makes. I think it also depends on my workbook that I have outside of those group events or like meetups with friends, how much capacity or aspiration I have for it's like being creative and leading and bringing ideas. But sometimes I'd appreciate other people being a little bit more invested. Yeah."*

## Question 7: If you have several options available, how do you decide which one to use?

*"I think there's like maybe two steps or three steps. First step is just like the majority. Like if we're 10 people for example and seven people are fine with cooking one thing and three say, yeah, I don't care. I'm fine with everything. Then I think it's obviously that choice. Second step is five. So I think it's very important that you don't only listen to majorities, especially in friend groups, but also try to always find a compromise that works for everybody that everybody's happy with. So yeah, I would also like to do it like that. I propose something and then there's people coming from maybe like half of the people or something. And if the other half isn't responding, then that's not my issue. Then I assume they are fine with whatever decision we make. And if they are not happy with the decision, I think I'd rather listen to them and like change my mind again and like put effort in finding common ground than just like being "stur" [sic]. And then I'm doing that one thing I propose initially and they didn't react to."*

## Question 8: When you’re with your friends, how do you decide how and what to eat?

*"  It's really just one person suggesting a few things, the others giving feedback. And then you're like, oh, cool. I like that. I don't really feel up to that. If there's allergies, of course you need to be respectful to that. But yeah, it's a short communication thing."*

## Question 9: Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced this?

*"I think so. I think everything influences how somebody perceives something or enjoys something. And I think if a person is super, for example, making some rules and another person is like, okay, sure, I'll do it because you like it so much, but I personally don't enjoy it that much. I think for the second person that might also be not as enjoyable as for the first person. But yeah, does that answer your question?"*

## Question 10: Do you feel like a decision maker?

*"Yes, very much."*

### Can you name one positive and negative experience you had as a decision-maker?

*"I mean, obviously, whenever you make decisions especially for a group, there's always a possibility that people won't approve your decision or if people aren't a fan of what you decided to do. I think a positive experience I make as a decision-maker is that people are thankful for me taking initiative and proposing something or just deciding around something and that they are happy with me doing it. What always gets me negative vibes whenever I do decisions and then other people disapprove after I made the decision, but I asked for their feedback and they said, I don't care or it's fine with me. So the negative experience, yeah, I'd say if I ask for feedback, there is no feedback or there's very little feedback and then I make a decision based off that. And then the other person that didn't give feedback disapproves that kind of annoys me."*
