# Transcript
## Question 1: What keeps you busy in everyday life?
That I don’t have nicotine. Too much. ETH. Doing sports twice a day (running/lifting). I don’t know—no time for real hobbies. The crappy project where they push five master’s theses on us simultaneously. The macros (counting calories). I think I don’t feel bad because everything is pressed into my mind, so I don’t feel bad. I’d rather go back to high school. It’s crazy what kind of free time we had back then.

I feel responsible for:

* Actually teaching something as a TA.
* Not just staying in bed.
* The only good white bread is pretzel bread. I eat toast every now and then.


## Question 2: When do you make decisions in everyday life?
Always. I try to make as few decisions as possible because it takes brain power.


## Question 3: How do you feel in a group?
In terms of work, I don’t feel like it; I always want someone else to do the effort. For leisure activities, I prefer smaller groups, not so big.


## Question 4: How did the last group get-together come about?
You pulled me out of the room and promised me Russian girls. Is it usually like that? 
It’s happened a few times before that you promised me girls, and it just turned out to be Jason.


## Question 5: Can you describe a situation in which the group has made a decision?
In their apartment, a "group" decided to create a chores schedule. Very democratic. Not at all one-sided.


## Question 6: How did it make you feel?
Like a valuable member of the shared flat. Can you describe that in more detail? No.


## Question 7: If you have several options available, how do you decide which one to use?
In this situation, there was a person who made the decisions because otherwise, they would throw a hissy fit.


## Question 8: When you’re with your friends, how do you decide how and what to eat?
Everyone says, "You decide," because nobody wants to deal with it. They cater to the people with the most dietary restrictions.


## Question 9: Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced this?
Yeah, it’s taking too long, so I’m relieved that we can finally just go eat something. It’s been too long. I don’t care; I’m hungry and want to eat something.


## Question 10: Do you feel like a decision maker?
No, I don’t care.
