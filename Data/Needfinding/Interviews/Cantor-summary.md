# Summary of Interviewee

## Person-Related Summary

### Summary of the person
The interviewee is a 22-year-old computer science master student. A generally undemanding person which is happy with most decisions other people are making. He emphasizes, that most group decisions don't bother him and thus lets other people decide on it. There are only rare occasions, where he thinks something is important for him and he takes the lead, he said that he can be very stubborn in those scenarios. Occasionally, he's the one which organizes group get-togethers and thus makes some decisions for the group.

### How was the atmosphere during the interview
The atmosphere during the interview was relaxed, with some jokes but also some more serious topics where he was very compassionate and took his time to explain rather complex social scenarios well. Was very talkative and went deep and more serious on some examples.

### How much did the person think about the question?
On some questions, he was not sure what was demanded, but upon further reassurance he seemed to have well-thought-through responses. In other cases he didn't know exactly what to say, thus we proceeded to other questions where he was able to elaborate on scenarios in great depth.

## Observations

### Concrete problems
* **Coding Problems**: Thinking about how to solve code problems, efficiently, well-structured and simple.
* **Scheduling a group-get together**: Organizing meetings through WhatsApp requires many back-and-forth messages until date and occasion is decided. Prefers to set up a meeting through WhatsApp chat messages instead of using the survey feature, too tedious one has to specify too many date options.
* **Deciding Food with dietary restrictions**: Problems deciding what to eat with colleague who has dietary restrictions.
* **Design Decisions**: Figuring out disagreements with others on design decisions (which affect user experience).

### Fields of concern
* **Mental Collaboration**: Deciding on when to speak and to listen to people in larger groups (five or more people) where nobody knows each other.
* **University**: Deciding to go to university or not and if attending, what to do during lectures (work on other stuff or watch the lecture).
* **Miscommunication**: Colleague was not collected by car for group-get together.

### General feeling
Interviewee was happy to elaborate on group dynamics. He showed regret for miscommunications and general disagreements with other people. Generally was very relaxed and said he is happy with most decisions.

## Others
The interview was conducted in a Teams call in Swiss German. Group get-togethers mostly get initiated if there's good opportunity, for example good weather. In this case usually someone volunteers to host the group and makes a suggestion to meet up in the group chat.
