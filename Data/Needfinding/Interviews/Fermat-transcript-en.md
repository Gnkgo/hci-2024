## Question 1: What keeps you busy in everyday life?

*"In the short term: if I somehow have time again in a few days or something or do something with friends. In a few days.
Medium-term: Somehow, maybe. Whether war breaks out somewhere near Europe, or? Somehow the economy somehow gets worse gets better I don't know and in the long term it's just the same. What I want to do later as a career, what I want to do with my life. Again with wars or something. Whether there might be a danger somehow. But also with the economy. Just a bit like that. Uh. Yes, and because you could somehow influence my, I'll say my standard of living. Could influence it."*

## Can you describe in more detail. What keeps you busy in the short term?

*"Well, yes. OK, now. At the moment. It's nothing yet, but last year, for example, with the training. Like this. That I then had to sort of see, OK, I'll write, I don't know, on Tuesday or something or on Friday. Of course an exam is not class work. And you have to study for it, don't you? Oh, I still have to write a report, so I can't really meet up at the weekend, because I just hate writing reports and I know for sure that I'll put it off even longer and stuff. Things like that.
Or I don't know, in general. Uh, you know that I'm with the [medical volunteer organization for young people]. I'm there somehow, there's another meeting and it happens to be on the same day as I want to meet up with friends. So then I have to decide whether to go to the [medical volunteer organization for young people] or to friends? Something like that."*

## Question 2: When do you make decisions in everyday life?

*"So how is this survey meant? Is it meant in terms of time or how is it meant? When? For example, I have to make a decision about whether I have to go to the toilet or not. For example."*

## As in which.

*"So it's, in which situation do I have to make a decision or when do I have to make a decision or when do I make a decision?"*

## Do you want to describe both?

*"Well, so when? I have no idea in which situation I have to make decisions. So actually all the time. For example, if [friend 1] says something stupid, I have to decide whether I'm going to make fun of it or whether I'm going to try to make fun of it. That wasn't so clever. Or something like that.
Or whether I have no idea. Whether I go to the toilet now or not for another 10 minutes. Well, that's just the way it is, I have no idea. That's what I mean by situational decisions.
And in terms of time, it depends. So if it's something I don't feel like doing, I try to put it off as long as possible. And keep all my options open, somehow. But for things where I don't mind or where I've more or less thought about it beforehand, I make decisions earlier."*

## Question 3: How do you feel in a group?

*"It depends on the group, so. If it's a group full of people where I just don't like the. If it's a group full of people who I somehow just don't like, for various reasons, then I don't feel comfortable in the group.
Can still talk to them somehow. So yes, I just feel relatively neutral in the negative direction somehow.
But when I realize, oh, the group is awesome, then I can talk to them for longer. But either way, I'm usually too reserved at the beginning, or at least I feel like I'm very reserved at the beginning."*

## Question 4: How did the last group get-together come about?

*"Uh, more or less via WhatsApp and so the last meeting was, I think, the Festival of Lights. Because it wasn't Festival of Lights. Yes, it's all the same. And we were there last year. And we wanted to go there again this year to see, hey, maybe there are new things, better things, worse things. I think there were only worse things, but oh well.
And we'd already met up two days before anyway, so we said to ourselves, well OK, let's just go to the Festival Lights again. Just go up there. Do something somehow."*

## Question 5: Can you describe a situation in which the group has made a decision?

*"We wanted to go out for dinner afterwards, didn't we? Yes, so none of us had eaten dinner. And then we had to decide where to go."*

## How did the process work?

*"The suggestions were made. So, either Burgermeister at Potsdamer Platz or [Chicken Restaurant] at Zoologischer Garten. And then yes. We voted or we just asked what the others wanted. Yes, so it was more or less a vote."*

## Question 6: How did it make you feel?

*"Neutral, because I didn't really care where we went."*

## Question 7: If you have several options available, how do you decide which one to use?

*"What the majority prefers, except. If there's a huge problem somehow. So I don't know. But then we try to find compromises. So that one time. Then we eat again, so we go looking for food. And there. Friend 2 [with religious eating restrictions] was with us and he went to a kebab stand because he wanted a kebab and we went to the mayor. We go to the Burgermeister quite often, I think.
Yes, well. Majority decision, right? So yes, majority decision or and compromise."*

## Question 8: When youâ€™re with your friends, how do you decide how and what to eat?

*"Everyone kind of says. What you're in the mood for. What kind of restaurants are there?
What's nearby or something or where you can get there relatively easily. Mhm, and then each person says where they want to go and, yes, then we'll probably go there."*

## Question 9: Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced this?

*"Not really.
I think so. Yeah, no, not really."*

## Question 10: Do you feel like a decision maker?

*"Well, yes and no. Well, I, I cast my vote, so to speak. So I say yes, I would want to go there.
Others do too. And then they just go with what most people are in favor of or something.
So I, I'm not the deciding factor. Always. Or the deciding factor in every vote. But
It's already my decision."*
