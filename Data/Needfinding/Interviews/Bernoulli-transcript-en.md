# Transcript (translated)

## Question 1: What keeps you busy in everyday life?

*"School, when I have lessons, hairdressing appointments, when I go to Migros, what I should buy, when I cook or exercise or that I get up early enough and don't oversleep."*

### Can you describe a situation in more detail?

*"Let's say I've made an agreement with my colleagues, we've decided to cook something, then we don't know what to cook yet, then we have to discuss it first and when we've finally decided, we have to see what we need. Then we go to Migros and maybe we need to have a list or just take the recipe with us. At home, we check whether we have everything."*

## Question 2: When do you make decisions in everyday life?

*"Yes, all the time. Where I go to eat and when, where I sit in the lecture hall, which subjects I attend at the beginning of the semester."*.

## Question 3: How do you feel in a group?

*"That depends on whether I know her. If I do, then very well. If I don't know them, I'm rather shy."*

### Can you describe that in more detail?

*"No. So if I know the people, I'm more inclined to say something."*

## Question 4: How did the last group get-together come about?

*"A colleague of a colleague wrote: yo come to this party and that's it. Then I said okay."*

### Can you describe the process in more detail?

*"Person 1 wrote to person 2: I know person 2 better than person 1 and person 1 said that person 2 should come to the party and person 1 said that I should come too or that I can come too if person 2 wants to and then I said ok, then I'll just come."*

### Is it usually like that?

*No. Someone writes in a group chat: Hello, hello, do we want to do something? Then everyone says yes or no. If everyone says yes, then there's just some date or something to do and then we do it."*

### What is the trigger?

*"Because someone wants to do it. Because they have nothing to do that day."*

### Do you sometimes write?

*"Less often than others, but sometimes."*

## Question 5: Can you describe a situation in which the group has made a decision?

*"Yes, for example, when we had to decide what we wanted to cook. We simply excluded everything we didn't want until we agreed on something."*

### Do you have another example?

*"Yes, what movies or series we want to watch together. That was similar. Exclude what you don't want to watch, make suggestions. Until everyone is more or less in the mood."*

### Is the process always like this? Everyone makes suggestions, then they're excluded and at the end there's something left over.

*"Yes, usually. Unless someone has such a good suggestion and is so convinced of it that they want to force it directly. But that doesn't actually happen as often as the other thing."*

## Question 6: How did it make you feel?

*"Good, because then we could finally start the series. Discussion is boring. Watching series is much better."*

### So you'd rather compromise than argue for a long time.

*"Not always, but sometimes. Maybe when I don't feel like it."*

## Question 7: If you have several options available, how do you decide which one to use?

*"It's not always democratic. Sometimes someone says how we're going to do it, otherwise there's never a decision. Sometimes we've also used a random generator."*

### Are you happy if one person decides alone?

*"If everyone is happy with several options and then one person says: this is how we're going to do it, then that's good. I don't have to think too much about it."*

### Have you ever been unhappy with a decision?

*"Maybe yes. I can't remember anything specific right now. But if it comes to a situation where someone simply has to make a decision and I'm not happy with it, then that option would already be ruled out because I wouldn't choose it. Otherwise, that's just the way it is."*

## Question 8: When youâ€™re with your friends, how do you decide where and what to eat?

*Someone usually makes a suggestion. If this doesn't suit the others, someone else makes a suggestion. It can also happen that we can't make a decision for a while. Then the discussion is finished and then maybe someone comes back and says: yo we finally have to decide something. Somehow we'll get around to it using the process of elimination."*

### Do you think that could be better?

*"Definitely. I don't like the constant discussion about it. It's a waste of time."*

## Question 9: Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced this?

*"I think less so. Sure, I might have wanted to do something else, but that's just the way it is. It's not like I'd sit in a corner offended and shout at everyone. At least I hope so."*

## Question 10: Do you feel like a decision maker?

*"Less than others in my group."*

### Why don't you take the lead?

*"I don't really know. If I make the decision, others might be unhappy with it. Then it's up to me. Maybe that's an influencing factor. It's always difficult to make a decision. I don't know why either."*

### Is that true for you?

*"I think it would be better for the others if I said: this is how it should be now, then the others wouldn't have to make this decision. If it's better for the others, it's also better for me in a certain sense."*

### But it was right for you?

*"That's fine. I think it would be better if I didn't make such stupid decisions. Even if I sometimes made the decision."*

### What's stopping you from changing that?

*"Nothing really. Just no balls. It's just more comfortable for me this way."*
