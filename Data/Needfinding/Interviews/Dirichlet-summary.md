# Summary of Interviewee

## Person-Related Summary

### Summary of the person
The interviewee is a 22-year-old tech-reviewer and economics student. 

### How was the atmosphere during the interview
The overall atmosphere was very relaxed, made some jokes and seemed to enjoy talking about the matters. Was very articulate and seemed comfortable talking about emotional effects and social interactions. Doesn't like big groups because it's hard to split work.

### How much did the person think about the question?
Wasn't sure in many occasions what was asked, he was often surprised by how general the questions were formulated. Upon telling him to go broad many times, he gave reflected and long answers with example scenarios covering the abstract questions posed.

## Observations

### Concrete problems
* **Making Personal Decisions**: Voiced having to make many decisions on what to do in certain moments. E.g. working on bachelor thesis or instead writing his tech-reports and solving university quizzes.
* **Identifying Deceptive Restaurants**: He had the experience where in a group they went into a restaurant and then the price was suddenly twice what was listed on the menu.

### Fields of concern
* **Uneven Team Workload**: Some people (or subgroups) not doing their job or only doing the minimum. In Swiss German he used the [backronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym) "TEAM: Toll ein anderer macht's", which translates to "TEAM: Nice someone else does it." Also, the opposite, one group of people doing the whole work and making decisions ahead of the group because they want a very good grade.

### General feeling
He seemed bothered by other people not communicating or not doing their assigned tasks. According to him, in group work there's almost always someone who knows more about the topic than the others, who will take the lead, he thinks this makes a lot of sense, because mostly he then doesn't really know what's best anyways.

## Others
The interview was conducted in a Teams call in Swiss German. He mostly focused on group get-togethers in a project-oriented group which are mostly centrally initiated.
