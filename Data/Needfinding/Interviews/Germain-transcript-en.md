## Question 1: What keeps you busy in everyday life?

*"In general?"*

## As you understand it.

*"Yes, I don't know about everyday student life.
Believe. So OK, I'll start with bigger things, like climate change, global conflicts. Then Unizeugs I think I just get through everyday life: Shopping, tidying up the shared flat, and all the things that keep me busy, mostly on the positive side. Um. What else keeps me busy? Finding time for myself and for my hobbies. Family keeps me busy. I think in terms of everyday life, it's often tidying up, cooking, cleaning, shopping. Getting to a lecture on time, going to bed early enough. Routine."*

## Question 2: When do you make decisions in everyday life?

*"I think all the time. So over and over again. So which bus do I take? Not for breakfast, really. Yes."*

## Do certain decisions pop into your head?

*"The examples mentioned earlier. But also. What else is bigger? Yes. I don't know, will I get around to it today? Maybe I'll buy one, that's something else. If I get an invitation, whether I accept it or not. How I organize my time, these are all everyday decisions."*

## Question 3: How do you feel in a group?

*"It depends on the group, on the situation."*

## Do you want to elaborate on how you feel in certain groups or what there is in general?

*"Yes, well, if we call my flat share a group, then it's usually very much so. I have 2 very nice flatmates, I think because I know them both and we already have well-established rules about how we treat each other and value each other as people that it works very well. Then maybe at university, if you just take the whole course, it's usually OK. So I think even if we do it in smaller groups, we usually treat each other with respect. So sometimes I'm a bit nervous if I'm afraid of saying something wrong. I think there's still a lot of pressure to appear intelligent and all that. I don't know. I had a meeting this weekend with, well I said with [exam support volunteer organization] because I work there and I took on a position of responsibility just in the summer and I've done almost nothing for it yet because I just had exams it was planned and everything. I had the feeling that I was a bit nervous, or that I didn't feel quite as competent as I would have liked, simply because I haven't been in this position for that long. But basically I was still very welcome and it was a good group to work with. Yes, I don't know."*

## Question 4: How did the last group get-together come about?

*"Today at lunchtime, I had lunch with my family in Ticino, at my grandmother's, my father's brothers were there, my great aunt, my grandmother's cousin, and it just turned out that way because they often eat there together on Sundays and I was there with my parents this weekend. Yes."*

## Can you walk me through it? How this came about.

*"OK. How I came to this, well, my mother called me on Tuesday, I think, at the beginning of the week, she told me that she and my father were going to Ticino because there was an event going on at the moment where various restaurants were presenting a certain menu. So it's a gastronomy event in the region where my family comes from and they had planned to go to the restaurant and they had told me. Just so that if I wanted to go home. If I had wanted to go, they wouldn't have been there and they would have liked to have me in Ticino. And then? I decided to go to Ticino because it just worked out well. I didn't have any other plans except for Saturday morning ([the volunteer organization for exam support]) and as of right now it's slow. So it's going pretty quickly now that the tunnel is open again. And so my grandmother, my uncle, is often at my grandmother's, simply because he always, because he doesn't have that many social contacts otherwise, so he was there, my grandmother lives at her house. And my other uncle also comes over often, so on Sundays anyway, lunch is often planned at home. And because my parents and I were there, they called my great-aunt. 
She is 92 and still lives alone.
But she would like to have you with her every Sunday.
But then she has the feeling that she.
But that bothers me.
So she's there especially for us, because she knows we're coming.
And my grandmother is in very close contact with her cousin and she lives nearby.
So she was there quickly.
Exactly, that's good enough.
Great."*

## Question 5: Can you describe a situation in which the group has made a decision?

*"Now at noon?"*

## As you understand it.

*"Okay, so if we're just holding this example. Keep. I don't know, I think it has. OK, that might be an exciting example.
It didn't exactly affect the whole group.
Is it still OK?
My great aunt, she has, so she's.
For 92 basically healthy, so she can still walk, she has problems, she doesn't hear so well and her eyesight is getting worse, but she complains that she's not well, but basically she still stands on her own two feet, she has people who, so she has such a, there's such a service that brings her meals every day, that is, she's so. She is promised for her, but basically she copes with everyday life on her own and. I saw that she had [symptom of an illness] and I asked my mother why. And my mother said it's quite possible that she's not eating enough [nutrients], that's a common problem when people get older and don't eat enough. And in this particular case, I spoke to my mother about what we could do to maybe give her a little more.
She's basically a very thin woman.
And she also said that she has lost weight in the last 10 years or in the last 2 years.
And then I discussed it with my grandmother, so first with my mother, what we could do, and then she said, yes, you can tell your grandmother beforehand.
Suggest that maybe when she goes shopping she can buy some [supplements with the nutrient] that she can take in addition and choose one that she might like.
So the decision will be up to her, but. We simply discussed that his action could be like this."*

## Question 6: How did it make you feel?

*"It was a funny example, because it reminded me a bit of a lecture situation when we had the topic [in lecture] and that or something like that. What problems people have in old age and that such a problem is that people lose weight and then just. For example, they recover less well when they fall down or are more fragile or fall ill more quickly. And I had to think directly of examples from this example, but my mother supported me well and then she gave me suggestions and I simply told my grandmother, it was very relaxed, but like that.
Good support, actually.
My grandmother told me.
Didn't quite understand something like that, because she actually meant through this, through these meals that my great aunt gets, that there's also [food with a lot of this nutrient] in it every day and that should actually be enough.
But I just told her yes. I mean. My mom thinks it might still be a good idea. And then she said, yes, I can, so she gave the example that my grandfather also had to take these [supplements], but he had a [different medical diagnosis].
And then sees that he bought these [supplements] in the pharmacy and that he didn't like them that much.
But my great aunt isn't actually that sensitive when it comes to food.
So she likes to eat and. That and I said that she doesn't have to go to the pharmacy.
She can also find them in the supermarket and there are lots of options and that she can just take [food supplements]. After questions like that, it shouldn't be that difficult for me."*

## Question 7: If you have several options available, how do you decide which one to use?

*"I think so, if we were already talking about food. There were different options. So my grandmother made polenta and then you could either add meat, beans or what my father does, he puts the polenta in a bowl, adds milk and sugar.
Each person could decide individually.
What you would like to eat."*

## Question 8: When youâ€™re with your friends, how do you decide how and what to eat?

*"I think usually someone already has a complete idea and then it's quite easy if it suits everyone.
Most food stalls or restaurants have several options anyway, so even if you agree on a certain cuisine, you can still decide individually what to have. Or? When you're out and about, you check what's nearby. So it's simple, you just go for it. It's always that easy. The easiest way to get it."*

## Question 9: Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced this?

*"So now to the hypothetical example with my friends or now at lunchtime."*

## Do you want to talk about both?

*"I can.
Well, what I ate today, I tried the beans because I've never had this dish before and it was very good, so basically I have to say that I like beans.
And then it wasn't actually that difficult for me to decide. So it was good and then I went for it. So it was simply because of the options that my family is not so complicated when you want something or don't want something.
And today was also influenced by the fact that I had eaten a lot, as I had done all weekend. So I didn't have a second portion, maybe on another day I would have had polenta with milk and sugar, so there were several factors that influenced my decision. Today it was just like that.
And that with my great aunt. Yes, me. Because my mother was so supportive, it was quite easy. So discussing it with my grandmother and perhaps having a positive influence. And. Yes, now, when you're out and about, what was the question again?"*

## Question 9 (Repeat): Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced it?

*"Yes, I think so. That communication is very important, because if someone simply insists, for example, that we go to this restaurant, but maybe half of the group already ate there last week and this other person insists and is not very open to this communication, then it can be very difficult and then the evening might not be so much fun?
I think that communication and how you treat each other plays a role in the decision-making process."*

## Question 10: Do you feel like a decision maker?

*"It depends on the situation.
Yes, I think if the decision.
I'm actually happy to do it if I have the feeling that I can make a good decision that is also in my favor. I can also make a good decision for. So whoever is affected by it, i.e. it's advantageous, then I'm happy to do it. And if I'm unsure, then I'm happy to get a second or third opinion or not get involved or support other people who should make the decision."*
