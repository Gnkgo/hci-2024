# Transcript

## Question 1: What keeps you busy in everyday life?
*"Camera, equipment, light, bachelor thesis, sustainability, reporting.\
Yes. Um, what else? Well, university keeps me busy. Yes, okay."*

### And what keeps you busy with these things?

*"So, what are the questions about?"*

### Well, for example, the first thing. You said camera, equipment and so on. 

*"Yes, well, I don't quite understand the question of what concerns me now."*

### In general. Just answer what you think about it. 
*"Well, I'm very involved in it, especially because I'm a tech reviewer, so I do tech journalism. And I also like it as a hobby and part-time job.\
So, in that sense, it keeps me busy. Yes. And university? University is the Master's module, along with the Bachelor's thesis, which is keeping me relatively busy at the moment.\
And just giving up and the quizzes that we have to solve. Yes. Okay, yes."*

## Question 2: When do you make decisions in everyday life?
*"Um, always, actually. Okay, yes. So, I decide whether I want to go to university, whether it's worth it.\
Or I decide whether I'm going to write articles or continue with my Bachelor's thesis. Or whether I'm going somewhere in Bern to do something. So, actually, all the time."*
### And how do you feel about these decisions? 
*"Sometimes more, sometimes less, good. Well, sometimes I don't regret it when I leave. Yes.
But, yes, big and very positive."*

## Question 3: How do you feel in a group?
*"What am I referring to now? To decisions?"*

### Just generally how you feel in a group, whether it's big or small.
*"So, big or small group in that sense, right?"*

### First of all, small group.
*"Er, small group is actually good.\
Especially when it comes to university stuff. I've had a few bad experiences, but most of them were actually good. With about 3-4 people.\
It can happen that you have a bad experience and then someone else in a team does it. Yes. The work depends on those who then want to do something.\
I haven't had larger groups yet. But I'm not a big fan of them, because the division of labour is really tedious there. And in the end, the yeast may not have done anything at all."*

### Can you describe that in more detail? Maybe first in the small group? 
"*TEAM, Someone else does it. (original language: 'TEAM, Toll ein anderer machts!') Erm, yes.\
Sometimes structures emerge so that certain things, for example, if you split the small group into two, split it again into subgroups, that you have a subgroup where you really want to work. And then you also want to push the others a bit. And then the other group, for example, doesn't want to do anything.\
Or as little as possible. And if the group that really wants to do things and wants to get good grades, then it simply takes over and then for the other group work afterwards, if you then have it with the same people, they just know, yes, we're not doing anything, the others are already doing it, and we have a good grade and that's sometimes a bit annoying. But if everyone is on the same page, then it goes well.\
Mhm, mhm. Okay. I've never had this kind of experience with a larger group.\
Max working with so many people, it's just a huge mess. I think so."*

## Question 4: How did the last group get-together come about?
*"Um, that was yesterday from the VSETH financial officer.\
From these associations, where VSETH showed us how to use their new accounting tool. You could register there. Yes, like that.\
So it wasn't a big group exercise, we could just ask questions. Okay, okay. Did you want to hear anything else about group work? Yes, so maybe other examples in general."*

### Yes, so maybe other examples in general. In a smaller group, how do such meetings normally come about?
*"Um, with a smaller group, it's usually just that you have to do group work. And then you either have colleagues or you just look for forums like this. I don't know if you have OLAT or what it's called.\
There are chats under the subjects where you can search for such groups. And that's how they come about. And then you exchange information via WhatsApp and make an appointment to do the stuff.\
Either live or via WhatsApp, Teams, or I don't even know what. You sent me a huge list. (Laughs)"*

### And what triggers such meetings? So now you've said groups... 
*"So it's mostly obligatory, yes."*

## Question 5: Can you describe a situation in which the group has made a decision?
*"Um, so in person or somehow completely digitally?"*

### Both, let's do in person first.
*"Um, in person, for example, after a lecture that we had in the group work, we exchanged ideas a little, for example, if we had time to sit together now.\
And we synchronised our schedules a little. And so we made the decision that we would keep the time then and then. Or that we could take the time right afterwards to get a quick overview, prepare ourselves and then come together again to finalise the whole thing.\
Yes, and digitally it was just so simple that we just wrote, yes, let's do it and then we'll do it together in the Zoom meeting. During the group work, for example, I'm just realising, I'm saying a lot of um, that we've decided that we're going to start with this, then move on to that, thematise that and so on. Yes.\
But it's usually the case that someone who you then realise has a little more knowledge after they take the lead and then they say, yes, maybe it's good if we add something there afterwards, do something there and so on."*
### So do you have an example?
*"Yes, last semester, for example, we had to write a few papers and then we had to make a Figma board via Zoom or teams if you said something. Yes.\
A, I can't even remember what it was, a prototype, a visual of what a workflow set should look like, also a bit in the CSCW (Computer-supported cooperative work) area. And that later on they simply set up topics where we should do something about it. And then someone said, yes, maybe it would be better if we included this and that and addressed it a little more, where a few people had worked in the field and knew a little more and then it crystallised a little and then you just did it, according to the topics in the field, not all at the same time, but you split up a little into the different ones, where you felt most comfortable."*


## Question 6: How did it make you feel?

*"Well, I was actually sympathetic, because I haven't worked in this field myself yet and it's always good when someone knows a bit more about the group work. That doesn't mean that I want to do less, so I don't expect the other person who knows more to do more. It's simply the task of saying afterwards, because we've all had some of that, but it's just that you can add something where you feel most comfortable and if you complement each other well, then it works.
We were lucky that the group was also good."*

## Question 7: If you have several options available, how do you decide which one to use?
*"For example, in the last group work? For example, yes. It was just a bit intuitive, there was no big discussion because we got on relatively well, we knew what someone was doing and then we just made sure that there was something everywhere.\
Or I can give you another example of a bad group experience, perhaps a little more interesting, where we were doing group work, there were four of us, and we already had two candidates who had registered for the group too late, i.e. hadn't contacted us before we wrote to them, and then we just had a look, the two of us, who had already been in contact about what we were doing, where there was really a lot of work, that we already had that, and then during the second part we realised that they hadn't done anything, so they hadn't really done anything, that we had really failed to do the main part and the important things, yes, and in the end we did everything ourselves, so to speak. Then we also had the advantage that we could then say, yes, this group member didn't do anything, so to speak, out of the group and out of the kicker, in the sense that there were no points, that was the possibility, they knew that too, so it was simply that after they didn't enjoy us so much because we did that, but then I didn't really care, because if a lot of group work is divided between two people, then you can't expect that you'll also be bundled in somehow if you just don't feel like doing it now. I would have understood if it had somehow been an emergency, but there, for example, it was like, yes, I had to go to training, and you've known for a fortnight that you have to finish it by then, and then they say, 'Yes, I couldn't today, I had to go to training, I had training all day, I had to suffer so much for it', and that's just unacceptable, especially because you know it, then yes, because you have the expectation that you won't somehow make use of it, or snitching. (Laughs)"*

## Question 8: When youâ€™re with your friends, how do you decide how and what to eat?
*"How and where or when?"*
### Both!
*"I think we do that, when the stomach starts making sounds. And just where we feel like it, I suppose."*
### How does this process work?
*"As soon as you're hungry, you ask the others if they are also hungry. You walk past the restaurants and asks 'Do you want this or want to eat there' or if you know it you say 'Yea this one is good, we could go there'."*

## Question 9: Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced this?
*"I think so, without this we probably wouldn't have gone eating. (Laughs)
So, or not, you kind of, well, you would have, for example, if you wouldn't say you'd already been D, then you might have either gone for the safe option, but, for example, when you're on holiday now, you usually go and try out the local stuff, then it's just like, which restaurant looks good, which restaurant looks a bit more expensive and so on, then you also go and look at Google Reviews."*


## Question 10: Do you feel like a decision maker?
*"Well, I don't think I can decide why you want to eat if the other person doesn't feel like it or something. I think it has to be a compromise.\
So if the other person really wants to eat hamburgers and the other wants sushi, then you just see where it's best for both of you. So, it's a bit difficult for me, but then you just see what both of them want or what the group wants. Yes."*

### So, do you think you've had a positive experience with such decisions or have you also had negative ones? 
*"Well, not with the decision itself, but with the restaurant. Okay, so in Lisbon, they sometimes have a bit of absolute scams going on. Yes.\
Where afterwards the menu was at least... Yes, that the menu is listed after the price and then the bill is somehow twice as expensive. Oh, yes. But you can't know that beforehand in that sense."*

### And how did you make the decision there? 
*"The menu looked good. Yes, and the prices were also reasonable. Yes.\
But, yes, in the end."*
### Have you ever had a positive experience with such decision-making procedures? 
*"Well, most cases are positive. Yes.\
I can only give a few examples. I don't know exactly what, so there are too many negative keywords. Okay.\
Yes, that's great! That's it!"*
