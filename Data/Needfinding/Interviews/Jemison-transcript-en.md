## Question 1: What keeps you busy in everyday life?
*"I think what occupies me the most is how I can structure my day, whether it’s meal planning or when I do my laundry and things like that."*

### How do you feel about it? Do you enjoy doing that?
*"I actually enjoy it, but I find it very time-consuming. I’ve never been able to put a good structure in place. It’s kind of all over the place. And I forget a lot of things because I have to write things down in different places, and then I forget to update them."*

## Question 2: When do you make decisions in everyday life?
*"Constantly. For example, when shopping."*

### Can you describe that in more detail?
*"Financially, but also in terms of quantity. Making sure I don’t overconsume or underconsume."*

### How do you manage to avoid over- or under-consuming?
*"Gut feeling. Yes, I try to have a vague list, and if I walk through the train station in the evening and pass through the Migros, I ask myself, do I really need this? And depending on how the day has gone, yes, I either need it or not."*

### How do you feel when you're in the store? How do you feel about it?
*"I think it comes quite easily to me. I can listen to my inner gut feeling well. I usually know whether I’m overconsuming or not. I feel good about it."*

## Question 3: How do you feel in a group?
*"It really depends on the people. I think if it’s a group of people who are very similar to me or are part of my circle of friends, then I feel very comfortable. I speak up and integrate myself well into the group and participate in discussions. But if it’s people I don’t know well, I sometimes feel insecure. I can’t really read what the others are thinking."*

### Why insecure?
*"Because I can’t read the body language yet, and I sometimes don’t know if they like me or not. Am I welcome here or not? The small things."*

### Can you think of a specific situation?
*"A positive one is when I’m at ETH and I see my circle of friends. I just walk up to them. For example, I like going into a room, seeing them. They all smile. I smile. I’m happy. I go over to them. That’s a very positive experience. On the negative side, I think everyone has experienced this at school. When you see a group and know that they aren’t really ‘your people.’ That would be a negative example."*

## Question 4: How did the last group get-together come about?
*"It was arranged. It was a lunch. We all agreed on a time and place via WhatsApp."*

### Can you explain the whole process again?
*"It’s actually not something regular. Our schedules often clash. I’m not sure if it was me, but I realized I hadn’t seen these people in a long time. I missed them, so I wrote, ‘When are you free?’ Then there was a long process. I didn’t have time at certain points. In the end, I set the time."*

### You decided the time?
*"Yes. I asked three people, and it was fine for them. So I went ahead with it."*

## Question 5: Can you describe a situation in which the group has made a decision?
*"There are also very spontaneous meet-ups. Just yesterday, a friend wrote to me at 3:30 asking if I wanted to grab a coffee. I said okay. We hadn’t decided on a location yet. Shortly before 4:00, we just agreed to meet somewhere. We knew we were close by, and every meeting point was just a few minutes from one another."*

## Question 6: How did it make you feel?
*"Good. I was mainly happy to see everyone. Where we met was secondary."*

## Question 7: If you have several options available, how do you decide which one to use?
*"There’s the Polimensa and the Unimensa. As a group, we had to decide where to eat. We all discussed it. There were kind of subgroups that talked among themselves and came to a consensus, for example, Unimensa. Then we discussed it between the groups. In the end, it was a majority decision. It was democratic."*

### How did you feel about that?
*"It took a few minutes, but I think it was fair. Even if it wasn’t the canteen I would’ve liked, I would’ve been open to both. I was mostly happy to see everyone, so it was okay."*

## Question 8: When you’re with your friends, how do you decide how and what to eat?
*"If I’m in a small group or just with one other person, it’s usually that we take turns deciding. One person suggests something, and the other person says yes or no. It’s usually a yes. Next time, it would be the other person’s turn to suggest. It balances out naturally."*

## Question 9: Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced this?
*"No."*

### Can you elaborate?
*"No."*

## Question 10: Do you feel like a decision maker?
*"Depending on the context, yes."*

### Can you give a specific example?
*"Just two days ago, I was in the lab, and I saw some people setting up a new scene. They said they could use some help, so I helped them. Then there was a big cupboard lying around on the floor that wasn’t assembled yet. We all discussed where we could store it, and someone had a good idea: ‘Let’s put it under the bed.’ It made sense, so we put it under the bed. In situations like this, I’m often the person who makes the decision if it happens to be a good suggestion."*

### Are there situations where you actively avoid taking the lead? Where you don’t want to decide?
*"When I feel it could be unfair, then I step back. Like when organizing an event and deciding who is or isn’t invited. I let others decide. Or at least we make the decision together as a group, deciding who comes and who doesn’t."*
