## Question 1: What keeps you busy in everyday life?
*"Er, er ...
Do you like programming a game right now?
So am I negatively busy or positively busy?"*
### Just in general, what bothers you in everyday life, keeps you busy, happy or whatever.
*"Let's say programming a game.
That means, of course, I should think a lot about how I'm going to realise something or how exactly something is going to be solved."*
### And what exactly is it that concerns you?
*"Erm, yes, often, erm, erm, erm, fuck. What's the best thing to say now?
For me it's like this, when I rewrite a programme, then you know, erm, if you have an idea, you have to implement it somehow.
And that means there are lots of different ways to realise it. There are nicer ways, there are more efficient ways, there are other ways. And then you actually have to be, erm, good at, erm, having a picture of exactly what you feel.
I believe that, yes.
Now we'll move on to the next question."*
## Question 2: When do you make decisions in everyday 
*"Erm.
So, now, er, just general decisions or now related to other things? On the game."*
### In general. What comes to your mind?
*"Um, in the morning I make the decision whether to go to school or not, so at ETH.
Erm, I make, er, during the lesson, so during the lesson, I make the decision whether I'm going to listen or whether I'm going to do something different.
When I'm programming something, I have to make decisions all the time about how exactly to implement something.
Someone spontaneously writes to me and asks if they want to make an interview like this.
And then I have to make the decision if I agree. (Jokingly)
Erm.
Right, well, that would probably be the main things now.
Let's move on to the next question."*

## Question 3: How do you feel in a group?
*"Er, it depends on how well I can do the group.
So, if it's like a group of colleagues or something, and then, er, quite well.
But now, if there are a lot of people that I can't, then."*
### So, what do you mean by a lot?
*"Er, yes, well, let's put it like this, well, yes, well, let's put it like this,
if there are 5 people with me and they're all talking to each other and you don't really know
not really all of them.
Yes, and it, I don't know, so."*
### Can you elaborate, with they are all talking to each other, what do you mean by that?
*"Yeah, it's just the, it takes so much, um, um, um, um, mental collaboration (original language: 'mentale mitarbeit'), like, comply with all the sayings and come in after a right moment
to come in when you want to say something or something.
Ah, yeah.
That just doesn't happen when you know people.
It happens less then.
And it's more like that, so, yeah, okay, yeah."*
### And how do you deal with a situation like that?
*"Er, well, when I'm stressed and stuff.
Er, just, just, just a bit stressed.
Er, it's very, er, um, tiring.
Mhm, mhm.
Well, you can't do it for long.
Okay, yes, very good. Um, next question."*

## Question 4: How did the last group get-together come about?
*"So, is it just generally in a group or now in a foreign group?"*
### Both. First of all, generally.
*"Yes, generally, uh, that was, uh, uh, last Saturday, where I, uh, where a colleague
just got back from Japan and then we met up. Um, I also completely
the whole thing and all the people were there too, where I sent them a group in the chat.
I sent them."*
### You initiated it? Did I understand that correctly?
*"Yes, I initiated it.
Mhm, yes.
That's now in the close circle of friends, you said.
Yes, fully.
Okay.
And now, er, in the, uh, unknown circle of friends, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
I can't remember anything right now.
Okay, that's good."*
### Um, what was the trigger? Well, you in the end or someone else?
*"Well, the main trigger was that my colleague came back from, um, from, from Japan
after a year. Mhm.
And the way he did it made me, um, write something to him on WhatsApp. And then
they just all replied when they could, and then they just kind of put out like that."*
### Okay. Is that usually the case, or was that a special case? 
*"Yes, well, it's usually, well, that's also a special case, of course, that
someone has just come back, but otherwise, for example, it's usually just a nice day or something
day or something, and then someone writes, er, whether they want to have a barbecue next week or something
or something, or something like that, or something like that, or something like that. Mmm.
Or there's something else going on here, you write. Yes, and, er, otherwise
often it's actually more that you, er, now so, uh, for example with a colleague just
something with a colleague, for example, and then you ask, yes, when you've just got the person
or something, and then there's a larger group that's actually larger to meet.
to meet.
Okay. Yes. Well, otherwise we'll go to the next week."*

## Question 5: Can you describe a situation in which the group has made a decision?
*"Er, describe what situation? Exactly. Or what is the situation?"*
### Yes, where a group has made a decision. Whether it's there now or another time, just in general.
*"Yes, well, then I'll take exactly the same example again. I've written one,
Yes, do we want to, er, do the meeting. And then, um, real people said,
yes, full. And then we, like, after a bit of back and forth, er, word exchanged, if it's
all of them. In other words, first we just said, yeah, so, the weekend. Then
then certain people said, yes, we don't have to go on Friday, on Saturday. And then
then said, yes, it's Sunday again. And then they just wrote through to the next week.
written through."*
### And it was all on WhatsApp? 
*"Yes, absolutely. We did it all on WhatsApp.
Okay. Good."*

## Question 6: How did it make you feel?
*"It was really good that everyone was there, but it did take a short time to come together.
It took a short time to come together. Er, you also, well
I also thought about whether I should do a survey like this on WhatsApp,
you can do that if you can do everything. So it was like, too much
too much effort. In other words, like, maybe we'll meet up during the week and then we could have
I would have had to specify 14 possible dates or something. And that's why I thought
thought it would be easy to just write down if you guys can and, yeah. But it wasn't
not so efficient there. Yeah, okay."*

## Question 7: If you have several options available, how do you decide which one to choose?
*"Er, so basically democracy, but, er, er,
uh, well, it always depends on how dirty certain people are against certain decisions.
decisions. Yes, well, if someone completely hates going somewhere.
Then we're less likely to do it than if you're standing neutral about something."*
### How exactly do you find out that someone "hates" something? 
*"Er, they usually say it."*
### Do you have any other examples of that? 
*"Er, to what example do you mean? A group get-together, right?"*
### Where we, er, made some kind of made a decision. 
*"Yes, so, er, if we now unpack the story of Benjamin (anonymized name)
The Benjamin story, um, we actually met in the group, he's a colleague.
He's not really in our group anymore. And, er, actually we've agreed
like we agreed that we would all meet close to the Reuss. Then it was like this, that we were driven to the place at the Reuss.
But afterwards, it was kind of like this, we thought he comes by himself. Because he lives very close, so we did not collect him by car. Afterwards he was quite miffed, and then he didn't come for the whole evening. Yes, yes. Yes, that was very sad. I think so.
Okay."*

## Question 8: When you're with your friends, how do you decide how and what to eat?
*"Well, um, I have a colleague who has digestion problems. Mhm. That means he eats practically nothing else other than rice. And, um, well, most of the time, you either adapt to him or he says he'll take something by himself.
something himself. And if he takes something himself, then it's usually just something that he can eat, and then we simply follow his decision. And, er, if he's more likely to take something he takes something with him, yes, then it's usually just something simple,
something grilled, pizza something that's done quickly. Yes. Okay. Erm."*

## Question 9: Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced this?
*Omitted on accident.*

## Question 10: Do you feel like a decision maker?
*"Puhi. Erm. I have this, um, daily habit of saying 'yes, yes' (original language: 'Ja, ja') to the questions quite often. Yes. That means, er, I
I'm not really the one who makes decisions, but I have the feeling that once I really, I really want to go through with something, then I'm quite stubborn about it."*

### So, is it okay for you to take the lead, so to speak?

*"Take the lead, so to speak? Is that right for you? Yes, absolutely. Yes, completely. Well, nine times out of ten cases I'm completely uninterested, then I just say 'yes, yes'. Yes. Erm.
But if I'm really interested, then I can make decisions."*
### And if you just answer 'yes, yes', why don't you take the lead now?
*"Yes, er, so it's just generally, er, it's not the case that, um, for example, um, let's say, if
someone asks, um, do you want to eat pizza or barbecue? Then I say yes. So, on the one hand
important to say, that doesn't mean that I don't want to eat, for example, because
I definitely want to eat. But it's just that I don't care what I want.
I want. Then I'd rather leave it to other people, where maybe, er, if it's
maybe 1% less indifferent or something, the decision. So, just like that, maybe, if
a person would rather have a barbecue than a pizza, er, then he'd better make the decision.
better make the decision."*
### Yes, that makes sense. Um, and in the case where you take over the situation, have you ever had a positive experience where you can say it worked? Can you describe that? 
*"Yes, actually the same example again, probably, uh, where we turn
turn to it, last time through. Mhm, mhm. Yes, fully. And it just worked out well there, why exactly?
So, yes, well, basically, because everyone was actually of the same opinion.
were, well, that is, this is, er, I've just proposed a project where everyone was actually
everyone was on board from the start. Mhm. And that's why it automatically turned out well"*

### You were the person who made the decision? 
*"Well, actually, I made the decision
and it came out negative afterwards. Or I made the decision and afterwards it came out negative or I made the descision and nobody was on my side?"*
### Both.
*"You ask questions. Um, yeah, um, if the decision works. Um, now, for example, I
programmed the game with a colleague. Mhm. And that's where we made the decision.
um, how big to actually make the UI now. And I didn't ask at all
asked whether we should make the video, whether we should make the video, whether we should make the video, yes,
but, yeah, um, if the decision maybe works. Um, yeah, um, if the decision
works? Um, now to the problem. I programmed the game with a colleague and we made the decision to programm the game with my colleague.
There we had to decide how big to make the you make the UI. And I didn't like it at all if the UI was unnecessarily large.
In other words, if you have a button permanently on the screen, it would cover half the screen. So that's a little bit of operation, very little. And there we simply discussed that he wanted the button to be smaller. Er no, that he wants the button large
and I could have it small. So that's a shitty example. But I did
other people after one and most of them said that the buttons should be large. \
And that's just the complete shit that they say."* (Jokingly)
