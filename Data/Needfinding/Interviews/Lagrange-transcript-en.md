# Transcript
## Question 1: What keeps you busy in everyday life?
I think my head is surprinsingly empty of worries and I just walk through the day and don't make any thoughts. If im in the bus bored and not on the mobile phone im thinking about chess or piano. My bandwidth is fully used by these things and I don't have space to be worried.

### How does it make you feel?
No idea. I think it's good. When I hear from others what their worrying. It comes how it comes.


## Question 2: When do you make decisions in everyday life?
All the time, there are these microscopic decisions. If you leave bed to get a third coffee for the day. Is it about these kinds of decisions? Yeah sure general decisions. The more relevant for the the more relevant for us. If I have a dilemma and I'm unsure im talking about it with a few friends, one by one. They'll help me with their inputs to decide. Smaller decisions don't need advice.


## Question 3: How do you feel in a group?
Friend group or what? Arbitrary group, whatever. There is the friend group with Alice on one hand. It's the silvester group. We we're 10 people every one is kinda the same age every one was on another place in live but it was fun with them. Earlier there was the chess group. It's fun when there's a hobby connecting eachother. At the university in groups it's fun you meet a lot of new people I think there's nowhere you make as much new acquiantances. If you don't always sit next to the same person. You sit with someone then talk maybe exchange numbers. It's fun. 

Of course some groups I don't feel well but that like that sometimes.


## Question 4: How did the last group get-together come about?
Yesterday, some of the silvester group met at my home. Andres promised some time ago to cook for us. His family was sick so it didn't make that much sense so we went with my home instead. We got a three stage menu, vegan. Vegan tiramisu. Wasn't as good as a normal one the coffee taste was missing was a strawberry tiramisu.

The deciding factor for the meeting was that the Finn came from Finland. He's very poor. He has no help from his family in Finland and lives alone with his girlfriend, has to save every cent to no hunger. He still comes to Switzerland to see us, that's like his highlight of the year. We met him a the one silvester. 


## Question 5: Can you describe a situation in which the group has made a decision?
Annelise tried to convince everyone to study in Lausanne. She prepared a subject, Life Sciences, for Alice and tried to have a one on one with everyone to convince them. But for everyone was more confortable with Zurich, as we know the language. For her it was to learn french. She has a funny worldview, she thinks if she studies in Lausanne she'll magically learn it after five years. In the end it was also that nobody of group wanted so she's alone now. Annelise studies informatics.


## Question 6: How did it make you feel?
I found it sad. She was a good friend. We'll still is. Even now that she's chilling with the french. I find it sad that she's far away, we haven't seen eachother for a while. But it didn't change my world. It's one person that lives away. 

She kinda lives her own life now it's a bit of drifting away. Maybe after the university we'll have contact again or when she will have lived into the uni live.


## Question 7: If you have several options available, how do you decide which one to use?
(Long pause). I think that's meant for when it's a decision for the whole group. I dunno someone has an idea we go to Graubünden. He first asks the people do you want? Then he plans and decides it on the merit of putting in the work. Ah you know, Axel from Alice? Yes. He spams the whatsapp questionaires with like: Do you want to do something? Yes, Maybe, No, etc. Then everyone kinda votes something and it's a chaos.

### Do you agree with this?
Yes sure. I mean you can decide if you want to go or not. Ah, what's also with this is deciding on a date in such a big group. Then comes a questionnaire from Axel with 5 dates where everyone votes for something else and nobody has an overlap. Yeah. 


## Question 8: When you’re with your friends, how do you decide how and what to eat?
There's always volunteers for cooking and they decide when, what. They say spaghetti with tomato sauce everyone happy? Then if somebody isn't they have to make a recommandation. 

### How is it with the vegans? 
If it's with the Finn we decide for him. It's just him that's complicated. We always give extra care when he's here because he spends, relatively to his poorness, a lot of money to come to switzerland. So we adjust for him and make the nicest food we can. 

### Going out to eat you never do?
To MacDonalds we rarely go. Sometimes we go eat a burger to eat. Aah. A friend always rides illegaly so we got him a month of GA for Switzerland and decided to go to domodossolo. 

### How did it happen that you decided to stop in Bern
Alice was complaining and said that it was much too long. And it wouldn't be economic because we'd have to ride for 6 hours to stay there 3 hours. She also lives near the German border and for here it would've been much worse. 

We wanted to go, when you start you have to finish. But for her it was very bad so we caved in.


## Question 9: Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced this?
In this situation I had the feeling that Alice had more decicions power than the other three. But that was ok because we don't make it extra hard for one person even when the other people wanted to do something other. The process was ok. Felt normal.

## Question 10: Do you feel like a decision maker?
More no. I see it sometimes as something bad for me. But I sometimes look after the other, how are they doing. I don't priorise my own opinion. In such a situation when Alice says, for me it's shit, I don't decide, I don't interject, well that's kinda a decision. I don't know

### Why don’t you take the lead?
It would be to tyrannic. I have too look for my minions. Not rule as a tyrant.

### That's ok for you?
As a ruler you should be chosen by the people. I don't know. I'm yapping. That's ok. This is the official ETH yapping course this is good and right. Thank you. Yes, was kinda fun.
