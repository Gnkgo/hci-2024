## Question 1: What keeps you busy in everyday life?

*"Especially everyday things, organization, doing everything at home, working. What's the schedule, when do I have to be where, etc."*

### What concerns you about that?

*"It's just normal thinking about how to achieve a goal. So if I want something in the fridge, I first have to think about what we're going to eat, what we need, when do I buy it, where do I buy it, do I have the money or the card with me, do I need another bag, how do I get there, how do I get back. Very simple things."*

### How does that make you feel? Does it have to be easy, or do you enjoy it?

*"No, it has to be easy."*

## Question 2: When do you make decisions in everyday life?

*"For every activity I actually have to decide, do I want to do this, how do I want to do this, when do I want to do this, with whom, do I want to do something with someone in my free time, do I want to stay at home or at work, for example, where do I go for lunch, and so on."*.

### Is that stressful?

*"No, it's free time, it's usually nice to do something."*

### Are the decisions at work or at home stressful?

*"Yes, certain decisions are more difficult, they might be more stressful, and certain things you've done before and you don't have to think about them too much, you do them the same way as last time or you have a recipe for how best to do them because you've already done them a few times. A few decisions are certainly difficult and therefore rather unpleasant."*

## Question 3: How do you feel in a group?

*"It very much depends on the people. I tend to be the one who listens and not the one who makes suggestions directly, but rather listens to what is suggested, checks whether I agree with it, but then makes suggestions if I don't like it."*.

## Question 4: How did the last group get-together come about?

*"If you can't meet in person on the street and arrange something, everything really runs via WhatsApp"*

### Do you have an example?

*"If I feel like doing something with someone on a day off, then I ask, do you have time, do you feel like doing something again? Then that's how it comes about."*

### What is the trigger?

*"Mostly because you think, I haven't seen this person for a long time, I want to meet them again or I want to discuss something with this person. Or I know I'm off next Wednesday, I don't have any plans in the morning, so that would suit me and then I'll ask if that's possible."*

## Question 5: Can you describe a situation in which the group has made a decision?

*"Yes, if the person says, yes, I'm fine, then maybe you write, what do we want to do, you make 2-3 suggestions, then the other person writes back, I would prefer that and if that suits me too, then you suggest a time and the other person replies, yes, that's good, that's it."*.

### Can you describe a specific situation?

*"I might ask, do you want to go to the movies, I'd like to see this movie and this movie, but there's also this one and this one next week, do you even have time? Then she might say, no, I can't then, but maybe in two weeks I can and I'd like to see this movie, then I say yes, I'm interested in that too, I'll come with you, let's do it."*.

### So one person makes a few suggestions and then a solution is quickly found.

*"Yes, exactly."*

### Do you have an example of a larger group?

*"These are usually groups where someone organizes something, a birthday or something, where you don't have to give a lot of opinions, but at most you ask if you should bring something and the other person says this and that please. It's clear what's going on."*

## Question 6: How did it make you feel?

*"Actually good, I've already made suggestions that I like, and I could have said, no then I'm not happy either. With WhatsApp you're not pushed into a corner, you always have time to reply, think about it, can I suggest something else, if I don't like it now, I have time to think about it and give it back and I can do it if it suits me, if I have 2, 3 minutes to deal with it."*.

### Do you have a negative example?

*"No, not really. At most with the family, when I say that I don't want to eat steak and they all say that we do want to eat steak. But if that's what the majority want, then that's the way it is. I can accept that more easily with friends than with family, if I say I don't want it at all, then I think you should find something in the family that suits everyone, if you can sit together and discuss it. But in groups, I agree if the majority want something different from what I absolutely want, then that's okay."*.

### Can you think of a situation where someone has made a decision against the will of the majority?

*"No, then I would say I'm not okay."*

## Question 7: If you have several options available, how do you decide which one to use?

*Whatever is chosen the most is done. Maybe they ask if two people don't like it, is it ok for you if we go there and then you can still say, no, then I won't come. But usually the majority decides where to go, so there is a choice and the majority decides where to go and those who don't like it at all are then perhaps asked again whether it's okay for them and they can still say, no, then I won't come."*.

### So the decision is made democratically?

*"Yes."*

### And if there is a tie?

*"There's always someone who initiates it and they usually make the decision. One half is for this and the other half is for that, but I think we should go for this, is that ok? The person who organizes it also makes the decision. He has to take the initiative because he has to come to a result."*

### Do you agree with that?

*"It's mostly about sitting together and then you don't care which restaurant it is."*

### And in a business environment?

*"There's always someone in the group who is very committed and some people might not care so much, they're more likely to give in, even if they don't agree."*

### Does that make you feel bad, or does it make further discussion more tedious?

*"Yes, further discussion would be more tedious. It would have to be something very important in my life for me to be totally against it and spend hours discussing it. In business, there aren't that many surveys or a clear majority."*

### Do you sometimes feel unfairly treated?

*"No."*

## Question 8: When youâ€™re with your friends, how do you decide where and what to eat?

*Yes, exactly the same as before. Someone writes a WhatsApp to a group or an individual, says do you want to go out to eat again and maybe makes 2-3 suggestions or just asks, do you want to go out to eat and the other person says yes, then and then we go, asks do we want to go there and there, because you want to eat outside because it's nice."*.

### And so you always come to a decision quickly?

*"Yes."*

### And in the family area?

*"Yes, I think you should find something there that suits everyone."*

### And that is sometimes not achieved?

*"Yes. Because that's where you can discuss things, otherwise it's all about finding a quick lunch or dinner somewhere that suits both of you."*

## Question 9: Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced this?

*"No. It's usually a suggestion where you can say beforehand that you don't fancy this or that restaurant. You can get involved beforehand."*

### Is the experience ruined if what you wanted wasn't decided?

*"Yes, so if you go somewhere you don't like at all and everyone else wants to go there, then you certainly won't go there with the same pleasure. If it's really really bad, then I'll just cancel. Then I say it's not for me and wish the others a lot of fun."*

## Question 10: Do you feel like a decision maker?

*"Rather no."*

### Why don't you take the lead?

*"It's not so important to me that you go to the 100% suitable restaurant, it's more important that you quickly and easily find something that suits everyone and that you see each other again."*

### So you're taking a step back to find a solution more quickly.

*"Yes, that it doesn't get too complicated. Because if everyone wants to have their explicit wishes fulfilled exactly, it becomes too complicated. That's why I tend to compromise and say it's not my favorite place, but it's okay."*

### Is that true for you?

*"It's my character. You can try to go beyond that, but you don't feel comfortable with it. I have to say, it's better if you stay in character."*
