## Question 1: What keeps you busy in everyday life?
*"Training my dog. Daily routines, the content of my day. I enjoy that again. I feel good about it."*

## Question 2: When do you make decisions in everyday life?
*"Over and over again."*

### For example?
*"Managing my rental properties, for instance. Continuing the courses I’m currently taking with my dog. My family duties, like surprising my daughter with dinner. Logistics of shopping. When should I do laundry? When is the best time to shop? But today, it’s only smaller things. Fortunately."*

### How do you feel about that?
*"I make decisions easily and gladly, and I decide intuitively. I consult my weekly planner. With existing appointments, for example. Then I really decide according to how I feel. From my gut."*

## Question 3: How do you feel in a group?
*"Very comfortable. Always have."*

### Can you describe that in more detail?
*"I have a weekly family dinner with my family. There are also various contacts with family members during the week. Once a month, I meet up with my girlfriends. Currently, we have a new group, a weight loss group. We’ll be meeting once a week starting next Monday. In other social groups, we get together for events like Carnival, birthday parties, or coffee and cake gatherings."*

### You feel comfortable everywhere?
*"Yes, I feel comfortable because I can decide which groups I want to be in and where I feel at ease."*

### How do you make that decision?
*"That’s the privilege I have now, not being part of the working world anymore. I no longer have to deal with compulsory groups. No more different quality groups or teams I need to work with. No projects with specific colleagues. That’s the privilege. Currently, I’m part of groups that have been established for years. And I’m also in a new group, in a club, which came about from a new interest and a new hobby."*

## Question 4: How did the last group get-together come about?
*"I scheduled meetings in my business."*

### And outside of work?
*"Once a year, we have a gathering where we, almost like in an association, set the program for the year. We do this once a year, always in November. The dates and activities are more or less fixed. Just before the meetings, there are suggestions for changes."*

### Is it like that with your other group meetings as well?
*"No, there are also many spontaneous meetups. In my circle of friends, there is a certain regularity, but they are always spontaneous, usually via WhatsApp inquiries or within the group."*

## Question 5: Can you describe a situation in which the group has made a decision?
*"Yes, for example, deciding on our retreat weekend for next year. That’s always a group decision, and it happened in person. But there are also decisions made via WhatsApp polls, like what time works for everyone or what food they want. We do that in connection with setting our yearly program. In November, we finalize the dates. Usually, I get the task of taking care of reservations. This year, we fixed the dates while we were on-site. We exchanged ideas at the table, consulted our calendars, and booked it right away."*

## Question 6: How did it make you feel?
*"I find it easiest in this group where I’m involved. Not everyone has credit cards, reservations, or computers. That doesn’t bother me. I feel good."*

## Question 7: If you have several options available, how do you decide which one to use?
*"I always try to streamline it by starting a poll at some point. It makes me quite impatient when too many messages go back and forth. I usually take the lead and start a poll to make it a democratic decision. Over the years, we used to choose a yearly theme at school, for example. That was a democratic process. People could suggest topics, and then we voted. Everyone had two or three votes. In two or three rounds, a yearly theme was chosen. It was always well accepted."*

## Question 8: When you’re with your friends, how do you decide how and what to eat?
*"I think we usually gather suggestions and agree on something. For instance, I remember our last family outing when someone looked at restaurant reviews or asked what people were in the mood for. It’s always a democratic process. I make suggestions too, but without the reviews."*

## Question 9: Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced this?
*"No. I don’t think that matters to me personally. Because of my personality, I’m very open. So I can easily adapt, and I don’t see it as diminishing my preferences. I can go along with it comfortably."*

## Question 10: Do you feel like a decision maker?
*"No. In my professional life, I had to take the lead. I really enjoy not having to do that in my personal life."*
