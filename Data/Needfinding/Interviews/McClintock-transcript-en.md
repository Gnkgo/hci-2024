## Question 1: What keeps you busy in everyday life?
Family, living costs, what to cook? What to eat? Homework under control at ETH?
Certain subjects are tough (organic chemistry). Migros bread is gross. Small whole grain bread.
Alexander buys terrible bread: Migros large white bread (tastes like cardboard).
Young adult life is new. Mom used to do everything, now it’s an adjustment. Eat when you want, freedom.

I feel responsible for:
* Doing the laundry, chores
* Passing the first year at ETH. My brother said it was super hard. Now he says it was easy.
* Responsibility for peace in the shared flat, harmony in the household
* I don't have to work, but Alexander does; he works every day.
* ChatGPT causes stress, doesn’t always give the same result, has said things wrong (like "locant number" instead of alphabetical order).


## Question 2: When do you make decisions in everyday life?
Daily. The last one, for example, was about whether or not to get vegan stuff for a friend.


## Question 3: How do you feel in a group?
In a group of thuggish types, it's bad; at ETH, it's good. Everyone at ETH is shy. ETH gives a confidence boost—it feels like you're contributing something to society.

What bothers me about groups:
* Constantly wanting to compete with each other
* When it's very competitive, and everyone remembers all mistakes
* When someone tries to back you into a corner
* Otherwise, not much
* On the bus, it’s uncomfortable (referring to past experience).


## Question 4: How did the last group get-together come about?
A friend got a monthly GA pass for his birthday, but he always wants to ride without a ticket. He wanted to visit Domodossola because it's the lowest point you can reach with a GA. Alexander mentioned it as a joke, and then we actually planned to do it. But in the end, we only went as far as Bern—didn’t feel like going any further.


## Question 5: Can you describe a situation in which the group has made a decision?
We had to make a trade-off, weighing whether it was still worth going to Domodossola. In the end, not going to Domodossola won out. Alexander didn’t feel like it either, then complained. After that, we convinced the others. Next time, we’ll go all the way to Domodossola.


## Question 6: How did it make you feel?
I was really annoyed. Friends and buddies have a bit of a particular nature. Sometimes you have to convince them. Last winter, the friends almost died during an illegal hike. I had to take control. The friends just weren’t capable in that situation.


## Question 7: If you have several options available, how do you decide which one to use?
Most of the time, when someone other than them makes decisions, it's Annelise. Usually, the decisions are fine. When reasonable people are involved, you end up doing sensible things.


## Question 8: When you’re with your friends, how do you decide how and what to eat?
It’s difficult with us because of the vegans. It’s a bit unfair. Most of the time, the majority says they’re craving burgers, and the others have to go to a different place. They just end up going to Coop to grab bread.

McDonald’s puts sardines in the French dressing (bad for vegans, and people don’t even realize).


## Question 9: Did the decision-making process affect how you experienced this?
I felt bad about it, but the friends are happy with it. The guys are shy, but most of the time, they’re agreeable, and there’s not much arguing. The vegan doesn’t shout around saying "eating meat is murder" either.


## Question 10: Do you feel like a decision maker?
It’s a wild mix of people. One of them, Annelise, has severe ADHD. They’re loud, with many opinions, but nice. However, often the opinions of the shy ones are overruled, and while it bothers them, they don’t take it too personally. The shy ones are also glad to get direction from people who can make decisions more quickly. (That’s) only the case with smaller things, though. They hang around while Annelise or I say, "Let’s do this."

The barefoot-nature friend had 40 ticks. I also need to check about vaccinations and what’s available. I’m not sure what’s out there.
